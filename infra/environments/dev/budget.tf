# Budget alerting.
#
# The first guardrail, and the one that catches the failure mode the others
# cannot: a benchmark left running, or a cluster nobody destroyed. Two budgets
# per account are free.
#
# Alerts on both actual and forecast. Actual tells you it has happened;
# forecast tells you in time to stop it.
